PHYSICS-ENHANCED MODEL - WEB INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

COMPLETED:
  1. Physics-enhanced model trained with 90.68% validation accuracy
  2. Multi-output architecture (classification + regression)
  3. Model weights saved and validated

INTEGRATION STEPS:

  1. COPY MODEL FILES:
     - Copy best_physics_enhanced_model.weights.h5 to public/
     - Ensure model_info.json is available

  2. UPDATE ML SERVICE (mlModelService.ts):
     - Already updated to load physics-enhanced model
     - Fallback to combined model if needed
     - Handles multi-output predictions

  3. TEST THE INTEGRATION:
     - Load your website in browser
     - Check browser console for model loading status
     - Test with sample light curve data
     - Verify predictions match expected ranges

  4. FRONTEND DISPLAY:
     - AIModelDashboard.tsx already configured to show:
       * Classification probability (0-100%)
       * Planet type classification
       * Temperature, radius, distance estimates
       * Model confidence indicators

MODEL PERFORMANCE METRICS:
     - Validation Accuracy: 90.68%
     - Classification Loss: 0.213
     - Regression MAE: 0.238
     - Regression MSE: 0.231

CONFIGURATION:
     - Input: Tabular data + Physics features + Light curve data
     - Output: [Classification probability, Regression prediction]
     - Backend: WebGL (TensorFlow.js)
     - Supports: Kepler & TESS mission data

NOTES:
     - Model will automatically fall back to simulation mode if not found
     - Large model file (~50MB+) - ensure proper caching headers
     - Consider lazy-loading model on demand

NEXT STEPS:
     1. Copy model weights to public directory
     2. Update your website build to include model files
     3. Test in development environment
     4. Deploy with model files to production

For questions or issues, check the console logs during model loading.
